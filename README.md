Dareyou lets everyone launch fun challenges to his friends or all web users who
may bet or directly participate in the challenge. Participants must submit proof
that they have completed the challenge, such as a photo or video (which may be
hosted on other site).

Referees, randomly chosen, then designate the winners. Winners receive karma
points, plus any other rewards specified in the bet / challenge. The losers
lose karma points, and may need to perform a task ingratte specified in the
challenge.

### Under the hood

The code is [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself),
[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) compliant,
concisely [phpDoc](http://www.phpdoc.org/)umented, but uses no class at all.
HTML and CSS are lovingly minified down to the last bit. No javascript needed!
